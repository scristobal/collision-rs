# Collision-rs

A tiny but effective helper library to detect collisions in $\mathbb{Z}^2$

> The use case is to detect collisions of basic shapes on a web canvas element, hence the integer coordinates focus, the quirky coordinate space (y-axis grows downwards) and the focus on targeting Web Assembly.
